# Multimodal Information Interaction for Medical Image Segmentation.

## Welcome to reproduce our code!!!

Our article is now publicly available on ArXiv. This repository provides the training code for the MM-WHS dataset. If you need to reproduce our results, you can use the training scripts provided in this repository.



### Dataset

The dataset used in this paper is the MM-WHS dataset, which can be found at [Multi-Modality Whole Heart Segmentation Challenge](https://zmiclab.github.io/zxh/0/mmwhs/). Additionally, the data preprocessing method used in this paper can be performed through the registration method described in the text.

### Run

In addition to providing the MicFormer code, this repository also includes training and testing code for state-of-the-art methods. These include VT-Unet, Swin-Unet, SwinUneter, nnFormer, and MedNeXt.
